    "## Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parts of the code might use data from different sessions. It is safer to erase them and create all files from scratch everytime. This is not a big deal because this code file should only be run once unless the data base changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some experiments did not pass the filtering methods of the previous functions despite looking very promising. Also, some experiments were not adequate yet they passed all of the filtering process. That is why we will store the names of those files manually.\n",
    "The code will take all zipped folders from the folder _D3Files_ and prepare them to get their .fli files extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it will check if there are duplicate zip folders. To check it it will compare the folder name and the hash sha256. Duplicate folders will be erased. For more information about hash sha256 check for example:\n",
    ">Wikipedia contributors. (2026, January 2). SHA-2. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 10:49, January 17, 2026, from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SHA-2&oldid=1330753870\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it will copy the contents of the zipped folders and create a new folder with the name of the experiment inside _D3Files_. No more zipped folders are erased and information gets duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, it will try to find all .fli files inside all the unzipped folders whether if they come from a zipped file or not. It will then send them to the newly created folder _AmorphousDataBase_. If, for each experiment proposal there are more than one .fli files, they get a numeric suffix (\\_1, \\_2,...) to distinguish them. Afterwards, all unzipped folders get erased leaving behind only the non-duplicated zipped folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All unzipped folders in D3Files will be explored, however they will get erased at the end of the pipeline. If you want them to persist for future runs of the code, they should be zipped first. **For ILL users, when navigating the ILL Cloud, the easiest way to prepare the zip files is to download the _processed_ folder for each experiment proposal. The code is \"smart\" enough to only process .fli files with polarization information. Therefore, there is no need to manually prepare anything.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some fli files have the wrong structure which means that they are not polarization measurements and if they are polarization files they may have used more than one polarization cell. Therefore, we need to remove all the non-polarization sets of data and separate the good fli files depending of the type of polarization cell they used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evey fli file we will read the contents and try to find the header (two strings in two consecutive lines). This symbolizes the installation of a new polarizer cell. If there are numerical values before the first header, that means that the process of saving the file occured before swapping the cell. Those data rows will be skipped. A correct fli file will have the following structure:\n",

    "\n",
    "Temperature did not seem to have an effect on the decay. Therefore, it has been eliminated in this code cell. Here is a summary of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code will go through the .fli files and find all combinations of consecutive rows with 'polariser cell info' and 'analyser cell info'. It doesn´t care about the order which makes the code more robust. We will consider that a polariser cell has been properly installed whrn both of these rows are present and that the cell has been changed once a new set of polariser and analyser rows are encountered. At the moment it ignores the experiments that use the 'magical box' as we are not sure if they are experiments compatible with the ones studied here\n",
    "2. For evey cell change, a new .fli file is created storing all the information including both polariser and analyser rows and the measured data rows. Also, all cell IDs are recorded\n",
    "3. For all .fli files the code now will:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Remove unwanted rows\n",
    "- Extract data form the header rows (polariser row and analyser row)\n",
    "- Remove unwanted columns\n",
    "- Set a time reference with the first measurement row. All other time values get referenced with respect to this moment in time and converted into seconds.\n",
    "- Ignore all Miller index combinations that are not integers\n",
    "- Run through all Miller index combinations until one passes all the filters defined in previous code cells\n",
    "- Plot the succesful experiments\n",
    "- Save two files for each experiment. One with the header rows and another one with just the numeric rows (with a new header that explains what each column has)\n",
    "\n",
    "For every succesful experiment we will output:\n",
    "1. Image:  \"PolarizationD3\\_{folder\\_name}\\_{DD}/{MM}/{YY}\\_{i}\\_MillerIndex\\_{PrettyCombination}\\_ExtendedArea.png\" in AmorphousPlotResults. Shows the plot with the extended area with the raw data\n",
    "2. Txt:    \"PolarizationD3\\_{folder\\_name}\\_{DD}/{MM}/{YY}\\_{i}\\_MillerIndex\\_{PrettyCombination}.txt\" in AmorphousMLDataBase. It contains the four data columns (DeltaTime, PolarizationD3, SoftPolarizationD3, ErrPolarizationD3)\n",
    "3. Txt:    \"PolarizationD3\\_{folder\\_name}\\_{DD}/{MM}/{YY}\\_{i}\\_MillerIndex\\_{PrettyCombination}\\_Parameters.txt\" in AmorphousMLDataBase. It contains the parameters (CellID, Pressure, LabPolarization, LabTime)\n",
    "\n",
    "These plots are not necessary but are saved for the user to know what all the files look like.\n",
    "The files that are wrong or useless when all is done are the folowing:\n",
    "1. Txt:    \"{folder_name}\\_Arrays\\_{i}.txt\" in SeparatedFolder/{folder\\_name}. It still has the header and useless columns. It is the fli file of evey chunk, of every recorded experiment (correct or incorrect)\n",
    "2. Folder: \"BadTest\" contains all the graphs of the data sets that were considered not worthy but had more points that the ones saved. Check them if your experiment was not properly added\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it erases all intermediate files and prepares the remaining ones for the ML pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removes all .fli files that have been created.\n",
    "2. Removes empty folders\n",
    "3. Collects all unique polariser–analyser ID pairs\n",
    " \n",
    "As a result, the only useful files are _AmorphousPolariserAndAnalyser\\_IDs.txt_ and the folder _AmorphousMLDataBase_"

The code is \"smart\" enough to only process .fli files with polarization information. Therefore, there is no need to manually prepare anything.\n",

    "1. The code will go through the .fli files and find all combinations of consecutive rows with 'polariser cell info' and 'analyser cell info'. It doesn´t care about the order which makes the code more robust. We will consider that a polariser cell has been properly installed whrn both of these rows are present and that the cell has been changed once a new set of polariser and analyser rows are encountered. At the moment it ignores the experiments that use the 'magical box' as we are not sure if they are experiments compatible with the ones studied here\n",
    "2. For evey cell change, a new .fli file is created storing all the information including both polariser and analyser rows and the measured data rows. Also, all cell IDs are recorded\n",

    "- Remove unwanted columns\n",
    "- Set a time reference with the first measurement row. All other time values get referenced with respect to this moment in time and converted into seconds.\n",
    "- Ignore all Miller index combinations that are not integers\n",
    "- Run through all Miller index combinations until one passes all the filters defined in previous code cells\n",
    "- Plot the succesful experiments\n",
    "- Save two files for each experiment. One with the header rows and another one with just the numeric rows (with a new header that explains what each column has)\n",
    "\n",
    "For every succesful experiment we will output:\n",
    "1. Image:  **\"PolarizationD3\\_{folder\\_name}\\_{DD}/{MM}/{YY}\\_{i}\\_MillerIndex\\_{PrettyCombination}\\_ExtendedArea.png\"** in AmorphousPlotResults. Shows the plot with the extended area with the raw data\n",
