Here you have an example of what files should go inside D3Files in PredictWithModel/FileReadingStoring.
Also you have the model folder with two already loaded models to use for prediction.

Just copy these folders and paste them inside PredictWithModel/FileReadingStoring and PredictWithModel/ML respectively (the two model folders together in ML)
